# JAMZIG

JAMZIG is a Zig-based implementation of a node for the JAM (JamCore) distributed system. This project focuses on providing a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for network communication and data processing.

## What is JAM?

JAM is a decentralized hybrid protocol that combines elements of both Polkadot and Ethereum. It provides:

1. A global singleton permissionless object environment (similar to Ethereum's smart contracts)
2. Secure sideband computation parallelized over a scalable node network (similar to Polkadot's approach)

The protocol is designed around a "collect-refine-join-accumulate" model that enables massive parallelization while maintaining state coherency.

## Why JAM?

According to the graypaper, JAM was developed to address five key goals:

1. Resilience: High resistance to being stopped, corrupted, or censored
2. Generality: Ability to perform Turing-complete computation
3. Performance: Ability to perform computation quickly and at low cost
4. Coherency: Maintaining causal relationships between different elements of state
5. Accessibility: Ensuring negligible barriers to innovation with easy, fast, cheap, and permissionless access

## In-Core vs On-Chain Computation

JAM introduces two distinct execution environments:

- **In-Core Computation**: Allows for massive parallelization of work across the validator network. Work done in-core is verified through a crypto-economic game of guaranteeing, assuring, auditing, and potentially judging.

- **On-Chain Computation**: Similar to traditional blockchain computation where all nodes must process and verify the same state transitions.

## Key Technical Features

- Implementation of the Polka Virtual Machine (PVM), based on RISC-V instruction set architecture
- Sophisticated erasure coding system for data availability
- Safrole consensus mechanism for block production
- GRANDPA for block finalization
- Novel authorization system for managing compute resources
- Bandersnatch Ring VRF for validator selection
- Service-based architecture replacing traditional account model

The protocol is designed to achieve theoretical performance of around 341 cores processing in parallel.
